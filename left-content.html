<h2>Programming, why?</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Programming and software-development has been one of my biggest interests for a long time! It started with
trying to make mods and levels for games that I enjoyed playing, and resulted in being my career choice, several years later.
While I am still in school, specifically for game development, I do some freelancing on the side! C# is the programming language
which I am trying to master in school, but I have known JavaScript for several years now!</p>
