        <h2>What I code</h2>
        <p id="code">Most of my repositories are freelance related and are therefore private. A lot of my work has been Discord
            bots and almost all of my work has been NodeJS related. I'm learning C# in school at the moment and
            I'm also trying to find time to contribute to more open-source projects but at this point I don't
            really feel like doing it. I experiment a lot and I'm still learning and I'm not looking for job
            opportunities or anything like that at the moment and I'm just here to be here :)</p>
