<h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I have several projects of freelance of experience. The two programming languages that I am comfortable with
are JavaScript and C#. Most of my work is done with JavaScript ande NodeJS, building the back-ends of multiple websites
and with fetching the data that is associated with it, feel like that sounds anything like what you need, send an email!</p>
